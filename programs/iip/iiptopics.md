## Think there is a topic here that MIAD should look at?
Send an [email to the Director of Emerging Technology](mailto:bendembroski@miad.edu): bendembroski@miad.edu.  This program works best if it casts a wide net into technologies that may be of benefit to MIAD students. No matter how obscure, we want to know about it!

## Computer Vision
Inquiries looking at how a camera connected to a computer can be used for 3D scanning, motion capture, and creating interactive experiences.
### Open Questions
- [What are the most versatile computer vision platforms for MIAD?](compvis/questions/compvis1q.md)
#### Proposed Questions
- Is the LIDAR system available on apple devices useful for MIAD students?
- What is the basic process of using motion capture to help with animation?
- What is the basic process of photogrammetry using tools readily available to MIAD students? 
- What is the basic process of using motion capture for real time environmental interactions?

## Projection Mapping
Projection mapping is the process of using conventional video projectors and 3D software to project on to three dimensional surfaces
### Open Questions
