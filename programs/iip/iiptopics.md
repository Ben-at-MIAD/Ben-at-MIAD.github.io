## Think there is a topic here that MIAD should look at?
Send an [email to the Director of Emerging Technology](mailto:bendembroski@miad.edu): bendembroski@miad.edu.  This program works best if it casts a wide net into technologies that may be of benefit to MIAD students. No matter how obscure, we want to know about it!

## Computer Vision
Inquiries looking at how a camera connected to a computer can be used for 3D scanning, motion capture, and creating interactive experiences.
