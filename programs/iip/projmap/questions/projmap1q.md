## Why this question is important, and what we are trying to figure out:
Projection mapping is a foundational element for creating powerful, dynamic, potentially intereactive, displays that inferface with the surfaces and objects in an environment.

We are now seeing more technically accessible projection mapping platforms that should lower the learning curve for students intersted in
