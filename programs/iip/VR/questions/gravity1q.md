## Why this question is important, and what we are trying to figure out:

The unique properties of Virtual Reality provide a new tool that can be incorporated into existing 3D modeling and 3D ideation workflows.  In particular, the ability to affordably work on a human scale in a digital 3D environment is unprecedented. There is no standard workflow yet established.  This line of inquiry looks at the popular title '[Gravity Sketch](https://www.gravitysketch.com/)' and how it relates to current and emerging 3D workflows already at MIAD.  The goal is to determine an indication of this particular softwares capabilities and limitations, and it's scope for enhancing student access to 3D ideation methodologies.
### Criteria for successful inquiry

- Short analysis of preexisting, publicly available tutorials and educational materials relating to Gravity Sketch
- Review and analysis of the learning curve involved in using the UI of Gravity Sketch, from the perspective of someone who is new to 3D modeling, and a more experienced user
- Description and documentation of the processes involved in using Gravity Sketch with the following titles and processes
  * Mesh modeling software such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), [3D Studio Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview), [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d), [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview), [ZBrush](https://pixologic.com/).
  * 3D printing
  * 3D CAD software such as [Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/domain/design-engineering) and Fusion 360(https://www.solidworks.com/domain/design-engineering)
  * Other 3D modeling methods such as [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/) and SketchUp(https://www.sketchup.com/).
