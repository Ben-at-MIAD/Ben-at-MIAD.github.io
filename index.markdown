MIAD's Emerging Technology Center is where the MIAD community discovers, explores and defines how emerging technology can enhance creative practice. If you have a MIAD ID, you automatically have full access to the space, and all the resources it contains. You don't need to take a class or have previous experience with any of the tools in the center.  This space is for *everyone*.

The ETC is here to help foster a growth mindset. We help students better work with the technology that exists now, but also be ready to adapt and work within the uncertainty that surrounds any new technology (even the ones we don't know about yet). This is a great place to learn how to learn how to use technology.

It's also a place of difficult questions, hard work, and fruitful failure. There are no easy answers here, but there is lots of support.

If you have a question that starts with "How can I..." or "What if..." you are going to fit right in.

## How
The Emerging Technology Center offers students several ways to get 'hands on' with technologies and processes that are new to MIAD.  All activity in the the ETC is driven by your curiosity and willingness to try new things. The best way to take advantage of what the ETC offers is to show up, and try stuff out.

You do not need to be enrolled in any particular class to use the ETC. However, often MIAD faculty will encourge students to use the resources in the center as part of their class assignments. Faculty that are interested in learning more about what the ETC can offer you and your students can email etc_group@miad.edu for more information

We also offer opportunities for students to engage in funded inquiry projects, and work to collaboratively with other areas and labs in the college.
