MIAD's Emerging Technology Center is where the MIAD community discovers, explores and defines how emerging technology can enhance creative practice. If you have a MIAD ID, you automatically have full access to the space, and all the resources it contains. You don't need to take a class or have previous experience with any of the tools in the center.  This space is for *everyone*.

The ETC is here to help foster a growth mindset. We help students better work with the technology that exists now, but also be ready to adapt and work within the uncertainty that surrounds any new technology (even the ones we don't know about yet).

It's also a place of difficult questions, hard work, and fruitful failure. There are no easy answers here, but there is lots of support.

If you have a question that starts with "How can I..." or "What if..." you are going to fit right in.

## How the ETC Works During Covid
The pandemic has altered how the ETC works, and has limited its capacity.  However, our core mission remains the same, as does our commitment to being a space equally accessible to entire community. The only thing that's different is how many people can occupy the space at the same time. Unfortunately, for the time being, that means no "walk in's". Access to the space is by appointment only.  We hate it, but we hate spreading COVID-19 more.

If you need to have some work digital cut (laser or vinyl) or you need a 3D print, start by seeing if our new [Service Bureau]({% link service/usingthesb.md %}).

If you are looking to get 'hands-on' with some of the tools in the space, reach out to us via email at etc_group@miad.edu to arrange an appointment.

## How
The Emerging Technology Center offers students several ways to get 'hands on' with technologies and processes that are new to MIAD.  The most important thing to remember is all activity in the the ETC is based on your curiosity and willingness to try new things. The best way to take advantage of what the ETC offers is to show up, and try stuff out.

We also offer opportunities for students to engage in funded inquiry projects, and work to collaboratively with other areas and labs in the college.
