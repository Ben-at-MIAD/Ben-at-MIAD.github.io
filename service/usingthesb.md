## How to Laser Cut, Vinyl Cut, and 3D Print
COVID-19 pandemic has limited on the number of people that can occupy the Emerging Technology Center at one time. To help ensure that all students can take advantage of ETC equipment for their coursework, we've setup a 'Service Bureau' that enables students to submit files that will be processed by ETC staff.

We are located on the forth floor, in room 440.

Hours of operation are:
Monday and Tuesday: 9AM - 3PM
Wensday 9AM - 6Pm
Thursday and Friday 9AM - 3PM

### Here's how it works:

1. Prepare your file for the process you need.  If you aren't sure how to do this, check out the links below , or [email](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu) etc_group@miad.edu.
2. Submit your file using the appropriate form. Each form has details on process and cost.
3. We will be in touch within 1 day (hours of operation) on the status of your job sumbission. Keep an eye out for communications from us!

In order to make things manageable for our staff, all cuts and prints done through the service bureau have limited options. If you need to do custom work, get in touch with Kayle Karbowski or Ben Dembroski and we can arrange for you to get direct access to the necessary equipment.

### A few other thing things to keep in mind

- Give yourself plenty of time.  Prints and cuts fail. There might be a problem with your file, there may be a large backlog of work.
- If there is a problem with your file, we will let you know the nature of the issue before we start the job. We can't fix the file for you. If you need help with the file, [book an appointment](mailto:etc_group@miad.edu).
- There are costs involved. We have done our best to keep these as minimal as possible, and are close to the normal usage fees for these processes.
